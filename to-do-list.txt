notifications, 
light and dark mode, 
status on profile page, 
is there a limit to picture size yet?
fix header on profile page
no background or header when you click on other peoples profile, 
no status
could have on profiles how many posts theyve made and how many comments if u wanted. (and to add on maybe u could see a list of those things if you clicked) but that seems like a lot of effort for that second part
maybe should just leave it at seeing how many they did not actually seein them
could have a thing that lets u put what country ur from, when u joined, when u were last seen
like online
